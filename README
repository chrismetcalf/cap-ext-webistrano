A drop-n replacement for Capistrano so you can run tasks in Webistrano from
your command line just using the cap command.

Usage
=====

You can still use the capify command to generate the initial files required by
Capistrano.

In your Capfile, insert the following lines at the end.

require 'cap_ext_webistrano'

The Webistrano extensions require a couple of configuration options that you
can specify in your deploy.rb. They're pretty much the standard options you'd
configure for your application with Capistrano.

set :application, "My project" # The project as named in Webistrano
set :user, "admin"
set :password, "admin"
set :stage, "test" # specify the stage you want to deploy
set :webistrano_home, "http://webistrano.mydomain.com/"
